\section{Glide Reflections}
Now we will introduce the concept of a Glide Reflection, and prove that exactly
3 reflections are equivalent to a Glide Reflection

As we saw in a precious section, three Reflections can create any isometry of
the plane where the orientation is flipped. In the case where all three lines
are parallel, they can be reduced to a single reflection, but in the case where
at least two lines are not parallel, they represent an operation that cannot be
reduced into any of the isometries that we have introduced; therefore we will
reduce them to a representation where each operation has a unique identity and
refer to this class of isometries as Glide Reflections.

\begin{theorem}\label{Glide Reflection}
  A Glide Reflection is a form of isometry represented by a composition of a
reflection and a translation parallel to the line of reflection; it is a
fundamental isometry which cannot be further reduced into components.
\end{theorem}

The irreducibility of a Glide Reflection will be easy to see, but first we will
look at how a Glide Reflection can be formed from three reflections, as this
will demonstrate the reasons for our choice of representation.

\begin{theorem}\label{3 Reflections form a Glide Reflection}
  A Glide Reflection can be formed from three Reflections, as long as the
  Reflections are not all parallel.
\end{theorem}

First we will consider the case where two of the reflection lines are parallel,
but first we need a supporting theorem which will be required to completely
reduce the Reflections:

\begin{theorem}\label{Glide Reflection from a Reflection and a Translation}
  A Glide Reflection can be formed from one Reflection and one Translation,
  regardless of the angle between the two isometries.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
  A Reflection and a Translation perpendicular to each other can be combined by
  moving the Reflection by half of the Translation's magnitude in the opposite
  direction.
  PROBABLY NEED A PICTURE TO PROVE THIS.
  Therefore, a Reflection and a Translation of arbitrary orientation can be
  reduced to a Glide Reflection by taking the components of the Translation
  both parallel and perpendicular to the Reflection line; the perpendicular
  component can be absorbed by moving the Reflection line, and the remaining
  two isometries make up our definition of a Glide Reflection.
\end{proof}

Now we can prove our 3 Reflection theorem for the following case:

\begin{proof}
  For a set of Reflection lines $L_{1}$, $L_{2}$, and $L_{3}$, where the first
  two are parallel and the third intersects both, they can be reduced to a
  Glide Reflection by combining the parallel Reflection lines into a single
  Translation. The resulting Translation can be at an arbitrary angle with
  respect to the remaining Reflection line, and as shown above, this forms a
  Glide Reflection.
\end{proof}

In order to show that any three Reflections can be made into a Glide
Reflection even if none are parallel, we leverage the fact that two
intersecting Reflections form a Rotation.

\begin{proof}
  For a set of Reflection lines $L_{1}$, $L_{2}$, and $L_{3}$, where no lines
  are parallel they can be reduced to a
  Glide Reflection by coercing two of the Reflection lines such that one of
  them is parallel to the third. This can be done because two intersecting
  Reflection lines compose to form a Rotation around the intersection point:
  First transform the two Reflections into the Rotation, then choose a new
  Reflection line through the center of Rotation that is parallel to the third
  Reflection line. It is guaranteed that a Reflection line exists such that
  when composed with the Reflection line that you chose it will reproduce the
  Rotation around that center point. Now that the lines that formed the
  Rotation have been transformed, you have reached the case where two
  Reflection lines are parallel and the third intersects both, which we have
  already shown to be a Glide Reflection.
\end{proof}
