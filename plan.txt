Prove that up to 3 reflections can reproduce any isometry of the Euclidean plane

It takes a minimum of 3 non-linear points to uniquely identify an isometry.
We will show that every possible isometry on a set of 3 points can be performed
with at most 3 reflections.

    0) Identity - 0 reflections
    1) Translation
    2) Rotated
    3) Reflected
    4) Translated and reflected
    5) Translated and rotated
    6) ... 

Other possible approaches:

Contradiction: Assume there exists an isometry that requires more than 3 
reflections...

Induction: Prove that for all n > 3, n reflections can be reduced to
k < n reflections.


2. 

Prove that exactly 3 reflections is equivalent to a Glide Reflection;

Glide reflection: A transformation composed of a translation vector t and a
reflection over a line r such that r and t are parallel.

First prove that for a reflections about 3 arbitrary lines, there exists
another set of 3 lines such that at least 2 are parallel.

Then prove that a reflection about 2 parallel lines and a transverse is a glide
reflection
